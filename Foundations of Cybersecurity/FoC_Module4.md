- **Importance of Playbooks**:
  1. **Chain of Custody Playbook**: 
     - Documents evidence possession and control.
     - Outlines who, what, where, and why of collected evidence.
     - Ensures evidence is kept safe and tracked.
  2. **Protecting and Preserving Evidence Playbook**:
     - Focuses on handling fragile and volatile digital evidence.
     - Consults the order of volatility to prioritize data preservation.
     - Improper management can compromise evidence integrity.

## Core Cybersecurity Knowledge and Skills

### Introduction to Linux, SQL, Python

- **Programming**: Used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.
- **Linux**: An open-source operating system.
    - Linux traditionally relied on the CLI, but modern distributions typically come with a graphical user interface (GUI), which allows users to interact with the system using windows, icons, and menus, similar to Windows or macOS.
- **Structured Query Language (SQL)**: A Programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.
- **Python**: Used to perform tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming, and that require a high level of detail and accuracy.

### Use Tools to Protect Business Operations

### Tools and Their Purposes

### Programming
Programming is a process that creates a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Security analysts use programming languages, such as Python, to automate processes. Automation reduces human and manual effort in performing common and repetitive tasks and helps minimize the risk of human error.

Another programming language used by analysts is Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is used to create, interact with, and request information from a database, which is an organized collection of information or data. A database can contain millions of data points, where a data point is a specific piece of information.

### Operating Systems
An operating system (OS) is the interface between computer hardware and the user. Common operating systems include Linux®, macOS®, and Windows, each offering different functionality and user experiences.

Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning its code is publicly available for contributions and improvements. While Linux is not a programming language, it utilizes a command line for user interactions. A command-line interface is a text-based interface that uses commands to communicate with the computer.

### Web Vulnerability
A web vulnerability is a unique flaw in a web application that a threat actor could exploit using malicious code or behavior, allowing unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.

To stay updated on critical risks to web applications, review the [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

### Antivirus Software
Antivirus software, also known as anti-malware, is a program designed to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses. It can scan a device's memory for patterns that indicate malware presence.

### Intrusion Detection System
An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. The IDS scans and analyzes network packets—small data units traveling through a network—to identify potential threats to sensitive data. It can also detect occurrences like theft and unauthorized access.

### Encryption
Encryption makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for unauthorized users, ensuring the confidentiality of private data. It converts data from a readable format (plaintext) to a cryptographically encoded format (ciphertext).

**Note:** Encoding and encryption serve different purposes. Encoding uses a public conversion algorithm to allow systems with different data representations to share information.

### Penetration Testing
Penetration testing, or pen testing, involves simulating attacks to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. It serves as a thorough risk assessment to evaluate both external and internal threats and weaknesses.
