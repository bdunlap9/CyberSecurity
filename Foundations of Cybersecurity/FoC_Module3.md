## Introduction to security frameworks and controls

- **Security Frameworks**: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

    - **Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. The security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws.**

- **Security Controls**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

### Purpose of security frameworks

1. Protecting PII
2. Securing Financial Information
3. Identifying Security Weaknesses
4. Managing Organizational Risks
5. Aligning Security with Business Goals

### Components of security frameworks

1. Identifying and Documenting Security Goals
 - **For example, an organization may have a goal to align with the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation, also known as GDPR. GDPR is a data protection law established to grant European citizens more control over their personal data. A security analyst may be asked to identify and document areas where an organization is out of compliance with GDPR.**
2. Setting Guidelines to achieve Security Goals
    - **For example, when implementing guidelines to achieve GDPR compliance, your organization may need to develop new policies for how to handle data requests from individual users.**
3. Implementing Strong Security Processes
    - **In the case of GDPR, a security analyst working for a social media company may help design procedures to ensure the organization complies with verified user data requests. An example of this type of request is when a user attempts to update or delete their profile information.**
4. Monitoring and Communicating results
    - **As an example, you may monitor your organization's internal network and report a potential security issue affecting GDPR to your manager or regulatory compliance officer.**

## Secure Design

- **Asset**: An item perceived as having value to an organization.
- **CIA Triad**: A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

    1. Confidentiality
        - **Only authorized users can access specific assets or data**
    2. Integrity
        - **Data is correct, authentic, and reliable**
    3. Availability
        - **Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it**

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

## Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance

The confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

### CIA Triad
The CIA triad represents the three foundational principles used by cybersecurity professionals to establish appropriate controls that mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

- **Confidentiality**: Ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized users.
- **Integrity**: Protects information from being altered or destroyed by unauthorized users.
- **Availability**: Ensures that authorized users have access to information and resources when needed.

Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used alongside frameworks to ensure that security goals and processes are implemented correctly and that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.

### Security Frameworks
Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They have four core components:

1. Identifying and documenting security goals.
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals.
3. Implementing strong security processes.
4. Monitoring and communicating results.

### Compliance
Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations. 

### Specific Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S.-based agency that develops multiple voluntary compliance frameworks that organizations worldwide can use to help manage risk. The more aligned an organization is with compliance, the lower the risk.

#### Examples of Frameworks:
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
- **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**

Note: Specifications and guidelines can change depending on the type of organization you work for.

In addition to the NIST CSF and NIST RMF, there are several other controls, frameworks, and compliance standards that are important for security professionals to be familiar with to help keep organizations and the people they serve safe.

### Regulatory Frameworks and Standards

- **Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)**: Applies to organizations working with electricity or involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. Obligated to prepare for, mitigate, and report security incidents affecting the power grid, adhering to Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards.
- **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®)**: Standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings across the federal government and third-party cloud providers.
- **Center for Internet Security (CIS®)**: A nonprofit providing a set of controls to safeguard systems and networks against attacks, helping organizations establish a better defense plan.
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: A European Union regulation protecting the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy. Organizations must inform E.U. citizens of data breaches within 72 hours.
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**: An international security standard ensuring secure environments for storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information to reduce fraud.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: A U.S. federal law protecting patients' health information, governing privacy, security, and breach notification rules. Organizations storing patient data must inform patients of breaches.
- **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**: Establishes international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management to improve processes and procedures.
- **System and Organizations Controls (SOC Type 1, SOC Type 2)**: Developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), these reports assess user access policies and cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety.

## Ethics in Cyber Security

### Definitions

- **Security Ethics**: Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.

### Ethical Principles in Security

1. **Confidentiality**: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data. Confidentiality, as it relates to professional ethics, requires a high level of respect for privacy to safeguard private assets and data.

2. **Privacy Protections**: Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use is crucial. This includes protecting personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII), which can cause harm if stolen. PII includes information used to infer an individual's identity, while SPII falls under stricter handling guidelines, such as social security numbers and credit card information. Security professionals have an ethical obligation to secure private information, identify security vulnerabilities, manage organizational risks, and align security with business goals.

3. **Laws**: Laws are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity. As a security professional, you have an ethical obligation to protect your organization, its internal infrastructure, and the individuals involved. To fulfill this obligation, you should:
    - Remain unbiased and conduct your work honestly, responsibly, and with the highest respect for the law.
    - Be transparent and just, relying on evidence in your decision-making.
    - Ensure consistent investment in your work to appropriately and ethically address issues that arise.
    - Stay informed and strive to advance your skills to contribute to the betterment of the cyber landscape.

### Ethical Concerns and Laws Related to Counterattacks

#### United States Standpoint on Counterattacks
In the U.S., deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal due to laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. The act of counterattacking is perceived as vigilantism, which can lead to escalation and further harm. Only approved federal government or military personnel are allowed to counterattack.

#### International Standpoint on Counterattacks
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) allows counterattacks under certain conditions:
- The counterattack only affects the party that attacked first.
- The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.
- The counterattack does not escalate the situation.
- The effects of the counterattack can be reversed.

Organizations typically do not counterattack due to the uncertainty and difficulty in measuring these parameters, as negative outcomes can be challenging to control.

### Ethical Principles and Methodologies
Due to the general disapproval of counterattacks, the security realm has developed frameworks and controls—such as the CIA triad—to address confidentiality, privacy protections, and laws. 

As an example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a U.S. federal law established to protect patients' health information (PHI). This law prohibits sharing patient information without consent, emphasizing the ethical obligation of security professionals to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards.
