A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process involving third parties, security breaches can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly as they can affect multiple organizations and individuals. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to:
- **Security and Risk Management**
- **Security Architecture and Engineering**
- **Security Operations**

- **Collision**
- **Downgrade**

Cryptographic attacks fall under the **Communication and Network Security** domain.

## Understand Attackers

Previously, you were introduced to the concept of **threat actors**. A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. In this reading, you’ll learn about different types of threat actors, their motivations, intentions, and how they’ve influenced the security industry.

### Threat Actor Types

#### Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
APTs have significant expertise in accessing an organization's network without authorization. They tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities) in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources.
- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents.

---

#### Insider Threats
Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Sabotage
- Corruption
- Espionage
- Unauthorized data access or leaks 

---

#### Hacktivists
Hacktivists are threat actors driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include:

- Demonstrations
- Propaganda
- Social change campaigns
- Fame

### Hacker Types
A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

- **Authorized Hackers**: Also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.

- **Semi-Authorized Hackers**: Considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.

- **Unauthorized Hackers**: Also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain.

Note: There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.

---

### New and Unskilled Threat Actors
New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including:

- Learning and enhancing their hacking skills
- Seeking revenge
- Exploiting security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics

Other types of hackers may not be motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types can be considered unethical or ethical hackers, working on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.

There are also hackers who consider themselves **vigilantes**. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.
