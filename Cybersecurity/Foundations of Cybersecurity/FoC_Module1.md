### Definitions

**Compliance**: The process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations, enabling organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

**Security Frameworks**: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

**Security Controls**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks, used alongside security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.

**Security Posture**: An organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and respond to changes. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

**Threat Actor**: Any person or group that presents a security risk, which can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

**Internal Threat**: A current or former employee, external vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk. This can be accidental (e.g., clicking a malicious email link) or intentional (e.g., unauthorized data access).

**Network Security**: The practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access, including data, services, systems, and devices within the network.

**Cloud Security**: The process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured and that access is limited to authorized users. It focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud, which consists of servers and computers storing resources in remote locations accessed via the internet.

**Programming**: A process used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks, which can include:
- Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)
- Reviewing web traffic
- Alerting suspicious activity

## Transferable and technical cybersecurity skills

### Transferable Skills

You have probably developed many transferable skills through life experiences; some of those skills will help you thrive as a cybersecurity professional. These include:

**Communication**: As a cybersecurity analyst, you will need to communicate and collaborate with others. Understanding others’ questions or concerns and communicating information clearly to individuals with technical and non-technical knowledge will help you mitigate security issues quickly.

**Problem-solving**: One of your main tasks as a cybersecurity analyst will be to proactively identify and solve problems. You can do this by recognizing attack patterns, then determining the most efficient solution to minimize risk. Don't be afraid to take risks and try new things. Understand that it's rare to find a perfect solution to a problem; you’ll likely need to compromise.

**Time Management**: Having a heightened sense of urgency and prioritizing tasks appropriately is essential in the cybersecurity field. Effective time management will help you minimize potential damage and risk to critical assets and data. Additionally, it will be important to prioritize tasks and stay focused on the most urgent issue.

**Growth Mindset**: This is an evolving industry, so a willingness to learn is crucial. Technology moves fast, and while you don’t need to learn it all at once, you’ll need to continue learning throughout your career. Fortunately, much of what you learn in this program can be applied to your ongoing professional development.

**Diverse Perspectives**: The only way to go far is together. By respecting each other and encouraging diverse perspectives, you’ll find multiple and better solutions to security problems.

### Technical Skills

There are many technical skills that will help you be successful in the cybersecurity field. You’ll learn and practice these skills as you progress through the certificate program. Some of the tools and concepts you’ll need to understand include:

**Programming Languages**: By understanding how to use programming languages, cybersecurity analysts can automate tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming. Examples include searching data to identify potential threats or organizing and analyzing information to spot patterns related to security issues.

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools**: SIEM tools collect and analyze log data, supporting analysts’ ability to monitor critical activities in an organization. This helps identify and analyze potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities more efficiently.

**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)**: Cybersecurity analysts use IDSs to monitor system activity and alert for possible intrusions. Familiarity with IDSs is crucial, as they’re key tools that every organization uses to protect assets and data. For example, you might use an IDS to monitor networks for signs of malicious activity like unauthorized access.

**Threat Landscape Knowledge**: Being aware of current trends related to threat actors, malware, or threat methodologies is vital. This knowledge allows security teams to build stronger defenses against threat actor tactics. Staying up to date on attack trends helps professionals recognize new types of threats, such as a new ransomware variant.

**Incident Response**: Cybersecurity analysts need to follow established policies and procedures to respond to incidents appropriately. For example, upon receiving an alert about a possible malware attack, an analyst would follow the organization’s procedures to start the incident response process, which could involve investigating the root issue and establishing remediation methods.

## Definitions

1. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Any information used to infer an individuals identity.
2. **Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII)**: A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines.
